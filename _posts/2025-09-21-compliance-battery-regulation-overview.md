## Introduction

The EU adopted the **Battery Regulation (EU 2023/1542)** on **12 July 2023**, replacing the **Battery Directive 2006/66/EC**.  
Unlike the Directive, this Regulation is **directly applicable** across all Member States and introduces a comprehensive framework covering the **entire lifecycle of batteries** – from design and production to reuse, recycling, and disposal.  

It applies to **all battery types**: portable, automotive, industrial, electric vehicle (EV), and light means of transport (LMT).  

---

## 1. Key Objectives

- Ensure **sustainability** and reduce the carbon footprint of batteries  
- Improve **safety, performance, and durability**  
- Enhance **collection, recycling, and recovery** of critical materials  
- Introduce **digital traceability** via the **Battery Passport**  
- Enforce **due diligence** in sourcing raw materials  

---

## 2. Main Requirements & Deadlines  

### 📅 General Application
- Regulation applies from **18 February 2024**  
- Battery Directive repealed on **18 August 2025**, with some transitional provisions  

---

### ♻️ Sustainability & Substances
- **Lead limit in portable batteries**: 0.01% from **18 August 2024** (exception: zinc-air button cells until 2028)  
- **Performance & durability disclosure**: EV, LMT, and >2 kWh industrial batteries – from **18 August 2024**  
- **Minimum performance values**:  
  - Industrial batteries >2 kWh: from **18 August 2027**

- LMT: **18 Aug 2031**  
- Industrial with external storage: **18 Aug 2033**  

---

### 🔎 Due Diligence (Raw Materials)  
- Economic operators must have **battery due diligence policies** (human rights, environment, responsible sourcing):  
  - Effective from **18 August 2025**  
- Commission to publish **guidelines by 18 February 2025**  

---

- **Labelling & QR codes**: Gradually introduced from **18 August 2025**  
- **Battery passport**: Required for **EV, LMT, and industrial >2 kWh** batteries from **18 February 2027**  

---

### 🔄 Recycling & Material Recovery  

**Recycling efficiency by 2025:**  
- Lead-acid: 75%  
- Lithium-based: 65%  
- Ni-Cd: 80%  
- Other batteries: 50%  

**Recycling efficiency by 2030:**  
- Lead-acid: 80%  
- Lithium-based: 70%  

**Material recovery by 2027:**  
- 90% for Co, Cu, Pb, Ni  
- 50% for Li
