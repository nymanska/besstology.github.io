Just finished listening to the [Energy Insiders](https://reneweconomy.com.au/) podcast episode **“State of Inertia and Potential for Grid-Forming Inverters”**, where Dean Sharafi (AEMO WA) unpacks the crucial role of inertia and the emerging importance of grid-forming inverters.

### Key Takeaways

- **Grid-following inverters rely on a stable voltage reference.** As synchronous machines retire, this reference weakens — threatening the stability of the entire grid.
    
- **Grid-forming inverters can establish their own voltage and frequency.** They don’t need an external reference, making them essential in high-renewable, inverter-dominated systems.
    
- **Digital inertia — especially from batteries — can respond in milliseconds,** and has been shown to be up to **8× more effective** than traditional rotating machines.
    
- **Inertia is disappearing not just from generation, but from loads too.** As induction motors are replaced with inverter-based technologies, we're losing ‘load inertia’ as well.
    
- **With lower system inertia, disturbances escalate faster.** This increases the risk of cascading generator trips, Distributed Energy Resources (DER) disconnections, and potentially widespread blackouts.
