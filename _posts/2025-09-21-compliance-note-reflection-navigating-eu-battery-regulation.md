Watching T√úV S√úD‚Äôs webinar *Navigating the EU Battery Regulation* reminded me how much the regulation is not just a compliance exercise, but a structural shift for the entire battery value chain. Dr. Mohamed Rajavar highlighted that the law is designed to force sustainability and transparency into every stage - from raw material sourcing to end-of-life recycling - and that no actor touching batteries can really escape its reach.

## Key Takeaways  
- The regulation covers all battery types and applies directly across EU member states.  
- Core requirements fall into four areas: 
  - CE marking (sustainability, safety, labeling)
  - Digital battery passport
  - Due diligence policies
  - Waste management  
- Delegated acts will define calculation methods for carbon footprint (Art. 7) and recycled content (Art. 8), making early data preparation essential.  
- Stationary BESS fall under Article 12 safety obligations, requiring hazard assessments, state-of-the-art testing, and emergency response documentation from Aug 2024.  
- Battery data access (Art. 14) will require State-of-Health (SOH) and lifetime information to be stored and shared through the BMS for reuse and repurposing.  

## BESStology Perspective  
- **Complex Responsibility Chains:** The regulation defines obligations by role (producer, importer, distributor, etc.), but in practice responsibility can shift between manufacturers, EPCs, developers, and asset owners. Mapping compliance duties across the value chain is complex, and clarity often requires expert interpretation.  
- **Data Access vs. Confidentiality:** Article 14 requires SOH and lifetime data to be shared through the BMS, but there are  controversies around how these are defined. Different methodologies exist, and disclosing them may expose confidential know-how, making data access both a compliance and IP challenge.
- **System vs. Module-Level Data:** For stationary BESS, Article 14 compliance is satisfied if SOH and lifetime data are available at the rack or container BMS level. But for genuine second-life use, module-level history is essential ‚Äî otherwise individual modules pulled from a system carry no verifiable health record. The Regulation sets the statutory baseline at system level, but the practical reality of reuse may demand deeper data access than what is legally required. It will be interesting to see how this is being dealt with in coming revisions.
- **CE Marking as Proof of Compliance:** Article 12 and similar requirements sit within the CE marking framework. The Battery Regulation defines the obligations (e.g., safety testing, carbon footprint, labeling), while CE marking is the formal declaration that these have been met. In practice, no battery or stationary BESS can carry a CE mark unless it fully complies with the Battery Regulation.
