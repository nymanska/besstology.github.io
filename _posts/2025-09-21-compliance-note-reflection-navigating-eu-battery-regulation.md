Watching TÜV SÜD’s webinar *Navigating the EU Battery Regulation* reminded me how much the regulation is not just a compliance exercise, but a structural shift for the entire battery value chain. Dr. Mohamed Rajavar highlighted that the law is designed to force sustainability and transparency into every stage - from raw material sourcing to end-of-life recycling - and that no actor touching batteries can really escape its reach.

## Key Takeaways  
- The regulation covers all battery types and applies directly across EU member states.  
- Core requirements fall into four areas: 
  - CE marking (sustainability, safety, labeling)
  - Digital battery passport
  - Due diligence policies
  - Waste management  
- Delegated acts will define calculation methods for carbon footprint (Art. 7) and recycled content (Art. 8), making early data preparation essential.  
- Stationary BESS fall under Article 12 safety obligations, requiring hazard assessments, state-of-the-art testing, and emergency response documentation from Aug 2024.  
- Battery data access (Art. 14) will require State-of-Health (SOH) and lifetime information to be stored and shared through the BMS for reuse and repurposing.  

## BESStology Perspective  
- **Complex Responsibility Chains:** The regulation defines obligations by role (producer, importer, distributor, etc.), but in practice responsibility can shift between manufacturers, EPCs, developers, and asset owners. Mapping compliance duties across the value chain is complex, and clarity often requires expert interpretation.  
- **Strategic Implications:** Compliance is no longer a cost of doing business; it is becoming a differentiator in accessing markets and securing long-term competitiveness.
