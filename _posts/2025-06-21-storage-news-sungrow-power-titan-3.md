Sungrow has unveiled the PowerTitan 3.0 BESS platform, available in 10 ft, 20 ft, and 30 ft modular container formats. The largest configuration delivers up to 12.5 MW/50 MWh per block using high-density 684 Ah cells. The design reduces land use by 45 % and cabling by 10 %, while a new liquid-cooled silicon carbide PCS delivers up to 99.3 % peak efficiency. The system is grid-forming capable, supporting advanced services such as synthetic inertia.

## Technical Highlights  
- Modular design for flexible 2â€“12 h duration projects.
  - 10ft: 3.45MWh  
  - 20ft: 6.9 MWh  
  - 30ft: 12.5MWh     
- Up to 12.5 MW/50 MWh per AC block using 684 Ah cells.  
- Liquid-cooled SiC PCS with 99.3 % peak efficiency.  
- Embedded grid-forming controls for advanced grid support.  

## BESStology Perspective  
- **BoP Cost Savings:** AC Block design reduces footprint and cabling, lowering Balance-of-Plant costs.  
- **High-Efficiency PCS:** Silicon carbide technology improves conversion efficiency and thermal performance.  
- **Grid-Forming Ready:** Supports the shift from grid-following to grid-forming operation, enabling future ancillary services like synthetic inertia.
