In power electronics, the terms **inverter**, **converter**, and **power conversion system (PCS)** describe key components used to transform electrical energy from one form to another. While these terms are sometimes used interchangeably, especially in commercial contexts, they refer to different functions.

This article explains what each of these components does from a technical perspective - and how they come together in battery energy storage systems (BESS). It is part of our Spotlight series expanding on the [ðŸ“‹ BESS Nomenclature Guide A-Z](https://www.besstology.com/posts/knowledge-base-nomenclature/).

## Inverter: DC to AC Conversion

An **inverter** is a power electronic device that converts **direct current (DC)** into **alternating current (AC)**. This is essential for applications where electricity from a DC source (such as a battery or solar panel) must be used to power AC loads or be fed into the AC grid.

Most modern inverters used in energy storage are **bidirectional**, meaning they can also convert AC to DC for charging batteries. Inverters operate using switching devices (like IGBTs or MOSFETs) and pulse-width modulation (PWM) techniques to produce a sinusoidal AC waveform from a DC input.

Inverters can be:
- **Grid-following**: Synchronize with an existing grid voltage and frequency
- **Grid-forming**: Establish voltage and frequency references, useful in islanded or weak-grid conditions

## Converter: General Power Conversion

A **converter** is a broader term that refers to any circuit or device that changes the characteristics of electrical power. This includes changes in voltage, current, or frequency, and includes three primary types:

| Converter Type | Input â†’ Output | Application Example                  |
|----------------|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| **AC-DC**      | AC â†’ DC        | Grid charging a battery (rectifier)  |
| **DC-DC**      | DC â†’ DC        | Voltage regulation between battery modules |
| **DC-AC**      | DC â†’ AC        | Inverter feeding power to the grid   |

> Clarification: Every inverter is a converter ACâ‡„DC, but not every converter is an inverter. Converters also include AC-DC rectifiers, DC-DC converters, and AC-AC converters.

## PCS: Power Conversion System

The **Power Conversion System (PCS)** is the complete hardware and control solution that manages power flow between a battery system (DC) and the electrical grid (AC). A PCS typically includes:

- A **bidirectional inverter** (DC-AC and AC-DC)
- Optional **DC-DC converters** for voltage or architecture flexibility
- **Filters, protection relays, and controllers**
- Communication interfaces for grid integration (e.g. IEC 61850, MODBUS TCP)

PCS units are designed to comply with grid codes, deliver fast frequency response, manage reactive power, and ensure safe and efficient operation across operating conditions.

## Summary
Understanding the distinct roles of inverters, converters, and PCS helps clarify technical specs, system architectures, and real-world capabilities of battery energy storage systems.

| Component | Function                    | Included in PCS? | Typical Use Case                |
|----------|-----------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------|
| Inverter | DC â‡„ AC conversion          | âœ…               | Interface between DC and AC      |
| Converter| AC â‡„ DC, DC â‡„ DC, DC â‡„ AC   | âœ… (if needed)    | Voltage, frequency, or current conversion |
| PCS      | Complete hardware and control solution | â€”                | Grid-connected BESS integration  |
