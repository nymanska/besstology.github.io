### üìå TL;DR

- Grid-forming inverters (GFM) operate as voltage sources  
- They set local voltage and frequency references
- Enable islanded operation and often black start capability

## Introduction

As power systems transition to high density of inverter-based resources (IBRs), maintaining stability without synchronous machines becomes a core challenge.  
Grid-forming inverters (GFMs) are emerging as a key technology to meet this need. This article explains what they are, how they differ from grid-following inverters, and their role in the evolving grid.

## What Is a Grid-Forming Inverter?

A grid-forming inverter is a power electronic device that establishes and regulates local voltage and frequency‚Äîsimilar to the behavior of a synchronous generator.  
Unlike traditional inverters, it does not rely on an external voltage reference. Instead, it defines grid conditions at its connection point.

GFM inverters are capable of:

- Self-establishing voltage and frequency
- Stabilizing weak or islanded grids
- Enabling black start (when designed accordingly)
- Supporting system restoration after faults
- Operating independently of synchronous generation

## Grid-Forming vs. Grid-Following

| Characteristic            | Grid-Forming (GFM)           | Grid-Following (GFL)     |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Control mode              | Voltage source               | Current source           |
| Synchronization           | Self-synchronizing           | PLL-based (follows grid) |
| Operation in weak grids   | ‚úÖ Stable                     | ‚ùå Typically unstable     |
| Islanded operation        | ‚úÖ Supported                  | ‚ùå Not possible           |
| Response to disturbances  | Fast (voltage control-based) | Slower (PLL tracking)    |
| Black start capability    | ‚úÖ If designed for it         | ‚ùå Not supported          |
| Synthetic Inertia capability | ‚úÖ Yes                        | ‚ùå No                     |

## Why Grid-Forming Matters

High penetration of IBRs introduces new system-level challenges:

- Low inertia
- Limited fault current
- Reduced voltage stability

Grid-forming inverters help mitigate these by:

- Providing synthetic inertia
- Acting as reference sources in low-inertia systems  
- Enabling islanding, black start, and system restoration  
- Supporting fault ride-through and reactive power services

## Real-World Adoption

- **Kauai, Hawaii** operates with up to 90% inverter-based generation, stabilized using grid-forming battery systems  
- **National Grid ESO (GB)** has implemented GFM specifications (GC0137) and a Best Practice Guide for new connecting assets  
- **Nordic TSOs** are jointly developing GFM requirements to address declining inertia and cross-border system strength

##  Summary for BESS Professionals

- Grid-following inverters inject current in response to an external voltage signal
- Grid-forming inverters generate their own voltage and frequency references
- For BESS applications, GFM is essential to enable black start, energization, and operation in weak or islanded networks

GFM is more than a control mode. It is a prerequisite for BESS to operate as active grid participants in high-IBR systems.
