On June 5, 2025, HiTHIUM successfully completed what it claims to be the first-ever all open-door large-scale fire test of its 5 MWh DC Block in Xiamen, China. Conducted by UL Solutions and observed by US fire protection engineers, the system endured 15 hours of open-door combustion under UL 9540A and NFPA 855 standards without thermal propagation to adjacent units, demonstrating robust passive safety performance.

*The container doors remained fully open throughout the test*

## Technical Highlights
- Test performed on 5 MWh DC Block with all doors left open, creating an unrestrained, oxygen-rich combustion environment.  
- 15 cm spacing side-by-side and back-to-back between battery containers.
- Conducted at 100 % state of charge (SOC) to stress-test the system under maximum thermal energy conditions.  
- Fire suppression systems were deactivated, relying solely on passive fire protection design.
- Carried out by [UL Solutions](https://www.ul.com/) and witnessed by certified US fire protection engineers; adhered to UL 9540A and NFPA855 safety standards.  
- After 15 hours of full combustion with flames exceeded 1,300 ¬∞C, the structure remained intact with no thermal propagation to adjacent containers.

## BESStology Perspective 
- **Fire Containment Cuts Land Costs**: Given that adjacent DC blocks no longer require wide separation, developers can use land more efficiently, lowering acquisition or lease costs and thereby improving BESS economics.
- **Higher Standards Limit Competition**: Stricter fire safety tests demand major investments for DC and AC Block manufacturers, favoring large players with resources and limiting competition from smaller companies.
