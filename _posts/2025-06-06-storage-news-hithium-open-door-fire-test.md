On **June 5, 2025**, HiTHIUM successfully completed what it claims to be the first-ever **all open-door large-scale fire test** of its ‚àûBlock 5 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS) in Xiamen, China. Conducted by UL Solutions and observed by US fire protection engineers, the system endured 15 hours of open-door combustion under UL 9540A and NFPA 855 standards without thermal propagation to adjacent units, demonstrating robust passive safety performance.

*The container doors remained fully open throughout the test*

**Technical Highlights**  
- Test performed on ‚àûBlock 5 MWh BESS with **all doors left open**, creating an unrestrained, oxygen-rich combustion environment.  
- **15 cm spacing** side-by-side and back-to-back between BESS containers; flames exceeded **1,300 ¬∞C**, yet no propagation occurred.  
- Conducted at **100 % state of charge (SOC)** to stress-test the system under maximum thermal energy conditions.  
- **Fire suppression systems were deactivated**, relying solely on **passive fire protection** systems for endurance.  
- Carried out by **UL Solutions** and witnessed by certified US fire protection engineers; adhered to **UL 9540A** and **NFPA 855** safety standards.  
- After **15 hours** of full combustion, the system structure remained intact with **no thermal propagation** to adjacent containers.

**BESStology Perspective:**  
- **Enhanced Passive Safety Validation**: The extreme conditions of this open-door test push passive fire protection beyond conventional benchmarks, reinforcing confidence in inherent safety design‚Äîa crucial factor in regulatory approval and project deployment.  
- **Benchmarking for Standards Evolution**: As BESS safety becomes a top priority, this rigorous approach could influence updates to global and national safety codes (e.g., UL 9540A, NFPA 855), especially for long-duration and high-density systems.
