HiTHIUM has completed the first **open-door fire test** on a full-scale battery energy storage system (BESS), validating its system-level safety design under extreme thermal conditions.

## Test Conditions

The test involved four 5MWh containerized DC blocks, each subjected to a compound set of stress conditions:

- 🔓 **Container doors fully open** (maximum oxygen exposure)  
- 📏 **15 cm spacing** between units (minimal clearance)  
- 🚫 **No active fire suppression** (passive-only safety)  
- ⚡ **100% state of charge (SOC)** (maximum energy dense)

The fire event was sustained for **over 15 hours**.

## Results

- ✅ **No fire propagation between adjacent containers**  
- ✅ **Structural containment maintained**  
- ✅ **Passive safety performance confirmed**

The test was conducted in accordance with **UL9540A** and **NFPA 855** standards, and witnessed by **UL Solutions**, U.S. certified fire engineers, and invited stakeholders.

## Why It Matters

Conventional fire tests are typically conducted in enclosed containers with suppression systems active. In contrast, this test simulated a **real-world worst-case scenario**: open ventilation, no intervention, high density, and full charge.

The outcome demonstrates that passive safety design alone can prevent fire spread at the container level — a relevant consideration for high-density deployments or sites with limited access to external firefighting.
