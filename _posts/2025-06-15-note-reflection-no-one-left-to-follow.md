An episode of the [Energy Insiders](https://reneweconomy.com.au/) podcast featuring Dean Sharafi explored the growing importance of grid-forming inverters as the energy mix shifts to inverter-based renewables. With traditional synchronous machines retiring, grid-following inverters lose their reference point, making grid-forming capability critical for maintaining grid stability.

> ‚ÄúWe know even 100% renewables is achievable. The challenge is how to get there safely without putting the system at risk.‚Äù

**Technical Highlights**  
- Grid-following inverters require an existing voltage reference, typically from synchronous machines.  
- Grid-forming inverters can set their own voltage and frequency, enabling operation without external reference.  
- Synthetic inertia from batteries can respond within milliseconds and has been measured up to 8√ó more effective than traditional rotating machines.  
- Load inertia is also declining as induction motors are replaced by inverter-based loads.  
- Lower system inertia leads to faster disturbance escalation, increasing the risk of cascading trips and Distributed Energy Resources (DER) disconnections.  

**BESStology Perspective:**  
- **Grid-Forming as a Core Function:** As synchronous generation retires, grid-forming PCS capabilities will shift from ‚Äúnice-to-have‚Äù to essential in utility-scale BESS.  
- **Synthetic Inertia Markets:** Rapid-response capabilities open new revenue streams as markets like Germany‚Äôs inertia procurement launch.  
- **Loss of Industrial Load Inertia:** As factories replace large induction motors with inverter-driven equipment, another traditional source of inertia disappears. This accelerates frequency changes during disturbances, making fast-response resources like grid-forming BESS even more critical for stability.
