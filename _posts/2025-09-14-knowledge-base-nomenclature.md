## A  

#### AC Block  
An AC Block, often referred to as the containerized (or cabinet) BESS Block, integrates battery racks/modules, Battery Management System (BMS), Fire Suppression System (FSS), DC protection, Power Conversion System (PCS), auxiliary systems, and a BESS Controller, providing an integrated BESS Block.  

---

## B  

#### BESS Block  
A complete Battery Energy Storage System consisting of DC Block, PCS, Medium-voltage transformer and Switchgear (possibly MV Skid), and BESS Controller.  

#### BESS Controller  
A controller responsible for monitoring and controlling interactions between DC Block and PCS.  

#### Balance of Plant (BoP)  
Balance of Plant refers to all supporting infrastructure required to make a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) functional-excluding the core DC Blocks, PCS & MV skids, and BESS/BPC controller hardwares. BoP typically includes civil works, DC/AC cabling, auxillary systems, installation, commissioning and support during Site Acceptance Tests (SAT). Depending on the project specifics, SCADA and controls setup may or may not be part of the BoP scope. A BoP contractor is typically responsible for delivering and coordinating all supporting infrastructure and interfaces.  

#### BESS Plant  
A complete Battery Energy Storage System plant consisting of BESS blocks (or AC blocks), Battery Plant Controller, and SCADA.

---

## D  

#### DC Block  
A containerized or cabinetized battery system including racks/modules, Battery Management System (BMS), Fire Suppression System (FSS), and DC protection equipment. Typically forms the core building block of a BESS Block.  

---

## E  

#### EPC (Engineering, Procurement, and Construction)  
An EPC (Engineering, Procurement, and Construction) contractor is responsible for delivering a complete, operational project. This includes designing the BESS Plant, procuring all necessary equipment and materials, and constructing the facility. The EPC contractor assumes full accountability for system compatability, procurement, delivery schedule, and functional performance.

## P  

#### PCS (Power Conversion System)  
Power Conversion System (PCS) converts energy between AC and DC. Enables bidirectional power flow and provides control of active/reactive power, voltage, and frequency to meet grid and operational requirements.

#### PCS & MV Skid  
Integrated containerized solution combining Power Conversion System (PCS), medium-voltage Transformer and medium-voltage Switchgear (MVSG).

---

## R  

#### RTM Controller (Route-to-Market Controller)  
A controller used for commercial dispatch, asset scheduling, and revenue optimization. Its role depends on the capabilities of the Battery Plant Controller and may often be omitted if the Route-to-Market provider can interace directly with the Battery Plant Controller (BPC)
