## A  

#### AC Block  
The AC Block, often referred to as the containerized (or cabinet) BESS, integrates battery racks/modules, Battery Management System (BMS), Fire Suppression System (FSS), DC protection, Power Conversion System (PCS), auxiliary systems, and the BESS Controller, providing an integrated BESS solution.
---

## B  

#### Balance of Plant (BoP)  
Balance of Plant refers to all supporting infrastructure required to make a battery energy storage system (BESS) functionalâ€”excluding the core DC blocks, PCS & MV skids, and BESS/BPC controllers. BoP typically includes civil works, electrical systems, transformers, grid connection, and auxiliary services. Depending on the project setup, SCADA and controls may or may not be part of the BoP scope, but are often included under the EPC contractorâ€™s responsibility. A BoP contractor is typically responsible for delivering and coordinating all supporting infrastructure and interfaces. 

#### BESS Block  
A complete battery and storage system consisting of DC Block, PCS (possibly MV Skid), and BESS Controller.  

#### BESS Controller  
A controller responsible for monitoring and controlling interactions between DC Block and PCS.  

#### BESS Plant  
A complete battery and restored system plant consisting of best blocks and plant-level battery plant controller

## D  

#### DC Block  
 Includes battery racks/modules, Battery Management System (BMS), Fire Suppression System (FSS), and DC protection equipment. Typically delivered in cabinet or containerized format.

---

## E  

#### EPC (Engineering, Procurement, and Construction)  
An EPC (Engineering, Procurement, and Construction) contractor is responsible for delivering a complete, operational project. This includes designing the system, procuring all necessary equipment and materials, and constructing the facility. The EPC contractor assumes full accountability for performance, schedule, and integration.

## P  

#### PCS (Power Conversion System)  
Power Conversion System (PCS) converts energy between AC and DC. Enables bidirectional power flow and provides control of active/reactive power, voltage, and frequency to meet grid and operational requirements.

## R  

#### RTM Controller (Route-to-Market Controller)  
Route-to-Market (RTM) controller used for commercial dispatch, asset scheduling, and revenue optimization. A route to market controller is an optional device that may or may not be required depending on the capabilities of the battery plant controller.
