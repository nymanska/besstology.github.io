# About The BESS Toolbox

**The BESS Toolbox** is a curated platform by **Gustav Nyman**, created to support professionals driving the energy transition through battery energy storage systems (BESS).

## ðŸ‘‹ Whoâ€™s Behind This?

Hi, Iâ€™m Gustav Nyman â€” an engineer and CTO working in the energy storage space. *The BESS Toolbox* is my independent space to share insights, structure field learnings, and build a living resource hub for everything BESS. Whether youâ€™re designing, deploying, or just trying to keep up with industry shifts, this platform aims to meet you where you are.


## ðŸ§° What You'll Find Here

The BESS Toolbox brings together a mix of:

- **Articles** 
- **Notes** 
- **Resources** 

Everything is written to be **practical, insightful, and fully grounded in real-world experience** â€” with just enough personality to keep things in tune with the people who actually do the work.

This platform is a personal project and reflects my own perspective. The views expressed here do **not represent those of any current or former employer** â€” just one engineerâ€™s effort to build something useful, open, and honest.

This isnâ€™t just a blog. Itâ€™s a toolbox â€” built to evolve alongside the industry and its contributors.

## ðŸ”‹ Energy Storage. Unboxed.

Built to be useful now, and expandable later - not unlike your favorite BESS site, except this one remembered to leave room for augmentation. Whether youâ€™re here to learn, collaborate, or dig deep into a specific topic, welcome.
