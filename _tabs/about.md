I’m Gustav Nyman, an entrepreneur and CTO working in the battery energy storage space. I started BESStology because I believe that sharing knowledge accelerates innovation and drives the global energy transition.

Here, I share clear, fact-based insights into the technologies, standards, and market trends shaping the future of Battery Energy Storage Systems - helping professionals make informed, forward-looking decisions.

Built to be useful now, and expandable later - not unlike your favorite BESS site, except this one remembered to leave room for augmentation.
